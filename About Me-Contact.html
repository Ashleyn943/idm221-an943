        Hello! My name is Ashley Nguyen and I am a student at Drexel University studying User Experience and Interface Design. Currently, I am focusing on learning more about UX/UI to hopefully create something that will help others navigate this technologically driven world. 

        Want to know more about me? Most people describe me as creative and my interests certainly reflect that. From painting to writing, I love making things and expressing myself. In my free time, I love playing video games, listening to music, and viewing other peopleâ€™s works. Other people are truly an inspiration for my work.
