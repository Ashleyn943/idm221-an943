# “eBay Redesign - Fixing Layout Issues” Page

## Overview
For a human-computer interaction class, I worked with 4 team members to redesign a website. This 3 week project focused on websites that failed many design principles that were introduced in the class. We chose to redesign eBay because, as a whole, the website is overwhelming and does very little to help the users navigate around. The team first worked individually before coming together on Figma to fix the design problems in eBay’s layout.

## Research
From our research, we found that eBay has been around since 1995. A lot of the old designs were clunky and distracting. While the current website is much better than the first one, it still fails to meet the design criteria successful products need. Considering its age, I chose to center my design choices around those with poor eyesight as that seems to be the trend of improvement for eBay. 

## Individual Prototype
Individually, we created prototypes based on our own intuition before coming together to combine the best features. My prototype focuses on making items more visible. Following my target audience, I made the decision to increase the text size and add more color to make sure everything can be seen. I also rearranged the layout to match the average shopping website.

## Group Prototype
Below, I featured both the original website and the team’s redesign. We all came to the consensus that the text size was too small and the entire website was overwhelming to look at. For the sake of information hierarchy, we put all the products into their own boxes to give the users an easier viewing experience. We also utilized features eBay already had. They put some of their products in boxes. so we just made sure all the products were in boxes. This way, the overall design was much more concise and less overwhelming to look at.

## What I would do differently
Given more time, I would have loved to redesign the footer of the page. While it is the standard footer, I wish we also made the text larger for viewing ease. I feel like we neglected the footer even though it is a major part of the website. Despite that, I believe the team did an excellent job redesigning the website.
# "Eco Points – A Product that Encourages Recycling" Page

## Overview
For a product design class, I worked with 3 team members to pitch a hypothetical multimedia product to help a problem in the community. For this month-long project, our goal was to help educate people on how to properly recycle and encourage people to do it more. We researched using news articles and surveys to truly understand how audiences see the problem.

I was tasked with sketching prototypes and designing the mobile app using Figma.

## Research
Our target audience was college students so we conducted a survey that was passed around Drexel’s campus to gather a diverse pool of answers. In the end, the majority of students agreed about recycling.

Most students said they lack knowledge when it comes to recycling and that they find it an inconvenience to recycle. Those two problems became the starting block for our solution.

We also looked into apps and products that try to achieve a similar goal to see what we can do to improve upon them.

## Rough Sketches
The team created 20 different sketches and ideas for our product. We took the best ideas from this sample to create our final products. I mainly focused on creating sketches for the mobile app as that was my job on the team. 

## Final Prototype
This was the final design I came up with for the app. I used green and a neutral beige to give users an environmentally friendly look. Like a lot of other products that promote helping the environment. The app allows users to connect to a recycling bin and recycle the products correctly. They can scan the item and the app will tell users how to prep the item for recycling. This app also rewards the users with points that they can use to purchase items from a vending machine.

## What I would do differently
I would take more time making the design cleaner. While it is a prototype, I think the cleaner environment aesthetic could be brought across clearer. I would also have liked to implement a way to make the features work on the prototype.

# "Squabble - Voice Chat made Simple and Fun" Page

## Overview 
For a mobile interface design class, I was tasked to design an app based on another app while making improvements to its features. I chose to create a voice chat app based on the app Discord. 


## Rough Sketches + Branding
I started by sketching possible screens for my mobile app. I tried to focus on aspects of Discord that I would want to add, such as the ability to see who is speaking on other screens and an easier way to see if someone is muted or deafened. Half of my sketches were based on one of the brand ideas I had, which after some peer review, I went with. 

As the word ‘Squabble’ is associated with birds, I chose to add a bird and nest aesthetic. My color palette also came from this idea. I wanted to stick to neutral colors and with one color to represent the brand. The app eventually evolved to have more browns to further push the nest theme. 

## Iterations 
My first prototype was created with visibility and usability in mind. I made text and buttons large so most users could read and tap them. I enlarged the buttons as they do exist on Discord but they are barely noticeable. I also simplified how the voice chat worked. I placed all the major buttons on the voice chat screen to make it easier to control. In addition, I added a visual element that shows everyone inside the voice chat if a person has all voices muted. This is the egg overlay that sits over a person’s profile picture.  

## Final Prototype 
In the final iteration, I shrunk down the buttons to be a more reasonable size. This way, the user could focus on the most important buttons before seeing the other features on screen. 

## What I would do differently
If there is anything I would change, it would just be adding sound to the animations. The final prototype does work to show the functions of the app but I think adding some sound effects would enhance the experience.
